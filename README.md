# 404s to Mars Hackathon – Cow Abduction 404

This repository contains the project developed by the team COW, Valeria Chacin, Anahí Kolofon, Micaela Arce, Virginia Sarrais, Sofía Ruiz, for the UDIT Hackathon, within the “404s to Mars” challenge.  
The goal is to transform the traditional 404 error page into a creative and humorous web experience: a UFO abducting a cow in a night scene.

## Purpose and Audience

- **For Users:** To provide an entertaining and visually engaging 404 page that turns a technical error into a memorable experience.
- **For Instructors and Jury:** To demonstrate teamwork, visual design, and CSS animation skills within the limited hackathon timeframe.

## Creative Concept

**Title:** Cow Abduction 404  
**Story:**  
The user lands on a missing page. In the darkness of the night, a UFO appears and abducts a confused cow.  
Displayed message: “404: Page abducted. Looks like the aliens took it with them!”  

**Core Message:**  
404 – Mars Abducted  

**Call to Action:**  
"Beam me back home" – a button linking back to the main site.

## Technologies Used

- **HTML5:** Base structure of the page.  
- **CSS3:** Styling and animations (no frameworks).  
- **Optional JavaScript:** Minimal, only if required for simple effects.  
- **GitHub Pages:** Hosting and live deployment.
